## üç∫ Setup
**Just click on [this link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=853527464257257492&permissions=536870912&scope=bot%20applications.commands) to add Anonymity Bot to your server. Thats all.**
<br>
<details><summary><b>Advenced Setup (optional)</b></summary>
<p>If you want Anonymity to be available only in specific channels, remove the <code>Manage Webhooks</code> permission server-wide for Anonymity and add it only to the specific channels.</p>
<details><summary>üëÜ Explanation</summary>
<p><strong>Anonymity requires exactly 1 permission. That is</strong> <code>Manage Webhooks</code><strong>.</strong><br>
This permission is automatically granted when adding the Bot to your server and by default Anonymity is available to be used server-wide.</p>

## üç∫ How to use
<video width="100%" controls autoplay><source src="https://github.com/Anonymity-Bot/anonymity-bot.github.io/raw/main/assets/anon.mov" type="video/mp4"></video> 
**Just use the** `/anon` **slash command.**\
Its that easy.

<details><summary>üëÜ How it works</summary> 
<p>The following happens in order</p>
<ul>
<li>You use the <code>/anon</code> slash command in a channel in a server.</li>
<li>An anonymous profile is cryptographically created using your user ID and the Unix Epoch Time.</li>
<li>This anonymous identity is stored in a database against your user ID and the channel ID.</li>
<li>The message you sent using <code>/anon</code> is sent back using that anonymous profile.</li>
</ul>
</details> 

## üç∫ How to change your anonymous profile

**Just use the** `/anon-regenerate` **slash command.**\
Its that easy. 

## üç∫ Spam prevention mechanisms
- **No `@mention` will ping anyone. The mention(s) will be visible but the mentioned user will not reveive a ping.** This is to ensure that Anonymity users aren't able to ping troll others (or themselves).
- Thats all for now. Feel free to suggest more.

## üç∫ Want to try Anonymity out before adding to your server?
**Sure! Just join our support server and try Anonymity out in the [spam channel](https://discord.gg/FxVwbse3yx).** 

## üç∫ Little Things
- The first time using the bot in a channel might take a little more time because of a complex calculation in the background. (About 1 second more.)
- Feel free to suggest me any improvements.
- I use my own pocket-money to keep Anonymity running and I make no profit.
- Therefore any appreciation of my work is appreciated. ‚ù§Ô∏è
