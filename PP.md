# Privacy Policy
I, the owner of Anonymity#6138 bot, store no meaningful data. All dynamic data is calculated during your interaction with the bot interaction. 

When the `/anon` slash command is used in a channel in a server, an anonymous profile is cryptographically created using the user's Discord ID, and the Unix Epoch Time. \
This anonymous identity is stored in a database against the user's Discord ID and the ID of the channel `/anon` was used in. \
Then the user's `/anon` message is sent back using the aforementioned anonymous profile.
